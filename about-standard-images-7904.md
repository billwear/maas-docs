MAAS can deploy standard (Ubuntu) or custom images.

## Standard images

MAAS standard images come from a SimpleStreams source. Canonical provides two SimpleStreams for MAAS images: candidate and stable. Both streams contain Ubuntu images, CentOS images, bootloaders extracted from the Ubuntu archive, and release notifications. Either stream can be used in any version of MAAS greater than 2.1 -- but not all images are supported in older versions.

### The candidate stream

The candidate stream contains images and bootloaders which have not been explicitly tested with MAAS. Canonical's automated build process dumps all images and bootloaders here before they are tested with MAAS. This stream is useful when testing a bug fix before an image or bootloader has been promoted to stable. Think of the candidate stream as a preview: it should never be used in a production environment; and users are encouraged to provide feedback on any issues they find with this stream.

This stream is available [here](http://images.maas.io/ephemeral-v3/candidate).

### The stable stream

The stable stream contains images and bootloaders which have been tested with the latest version of MAAS. This is the default stream which should be used in production environments.  This stream is available [here](http://images.maas.io/ephemeral-v3/stable).

### The retired daily stream

Previously there was only one MAAS stream available, daily. This stream has been replaced by the stable stream. Any client using this stream will be automatically redirected to the stable stream.

## Custom images

MAAS allows you to upload and deploy custom images beyond the [MAAS image repository](http://images.maas.io). However, generic ISO images require modifications before they can be used. A valid MAAS image must include:  

- A **curtin hook script** to write and boot the image.  
- **Cloud-init metadata** for networking, storage, users, and software.  

### Preparing custom images  

You can create MAAS-compatible images in two ways:  

1. **Hand-build images** (requires deep understanding of curtin/cloud-init).  
2. **Use [Packer](https://www.packer.io)** to automate the process.  

For supported operating systems, Canonical provides [Packer templates](https://github.com/canonical/packer-maas). Custom images are not officially supported due to licensing and compatibility risks. **Canonical strongly recommends using cloud-init or curtin for customization instead of building custom images.**  

### Static Ubuntu images  

Static images are pre-configured Ubuntu OS images deployable via MAAS. They include users, packages, and configurations but remain fixed post-deployment. This method is mainly for MAAS versions `<3.1`, but works on all versions.  

For MAAS `3.0+`, **Packer is recommended** due to its built-in Ubuntu image customization capabilities.  

### Uploading hand-built images  

A hand-built image must include:  

- A **kernel**  
- A **bootloader**  
- A **curtin network hook** (`/curtin/curtin-hooks`)  

It must be in **raw `.img` format** (required by MAAS). Once built, upload it via:  

```bash
maas $PROFILE boot-resources create \
    name='custom/ubuntu' \
    title='Ubuntu Custom' \
    architecture='amd64/generic' \
    filetype='tgz' \
    content@=custom-ubuntu.img
```

### How MAAS handles custom images  

- MAAS stores uploaded images in the database as `.tar.gz` files.  
- It distinguishes between Ubuntu and non-Ubuntu images, applying the correct pre-seed configs.  
- **Custom images always boot with an ephemeral Ubuntu OS before deployment.**  
- The `base_image` field ensures compatibility between the ephemeral OS and the custom image.  

### Deployment & boot process  

1. **MAAS loads the imageâ€™s kernel, bootloader, and root filesystem.**  
2. **An ephemeral OS (matching the custom image version) boots first.**  
3. **Curtin writes the full custom image to disk.**  
4. **After writing, MAAS does not modify the custom image.**  

For non-Ubuntu images, an Ubuntu ephemeral OS still boots first before switching to the custom OS.  

### Network & storage configuration  

- **Networking:** MAAS-configured network settings apply automatically.  
- **Storage:** Root partitions can be resized, and additional block devices can be attached/formatted.  
- **Verification:** MAAS aborts installation if `cloud-init` or `netplan` is missing.  

### Static image metrics  

The MAAS dashboard tracks the number of deployed static images.  

## Packer  

[Packer](https://www.packer.io/docs) automates OS image creation for MAAS deployment. It uses **HCL2 templates** to define build, provisioning, and post-processing steps.  

> *Note: Packer is the recommended approach to build custom images. Use `cloud-init` or `curtin` instead of custom images for minimal customizations.*
### Packer workflow  

1. **Define a template** (HCL2 format).  
2. **Select a builder** (e.g., QEMU, Anaconda).  
3. **Run provisioners** (install software, configure settings).  
4. **Apply post-processors** (e.g., compressing into `.tar.gz`).  

Packer outputs **artifacts** (loadable images). In MAAS, these are simply called **images**.  

### Packer image creation process  

- **Builders** create base OS images.  
- **Provisioners** customize images (`curtin` hooks, `cloud-init`, packages).  
- **Post-processors** finalize the image for deployment (e.g., compression).  

### Dependencies for Ubuntu images  

To build an Ubuntu image with `packer-maas`, install:  

```bash
sudo apt install qemu-utils qemu-system ovmf cloud-image-utils
```

### Packer templates  

A [Packer template](https://www.packer.io/docs/templates) (written in HCL2) defines the entire image-building process. It includes:  

- **Variables** (image type, architecture, file paths).  
- **Source declaration** (how the image is built).  
- **Provisioners** (installation/configuration scripts).  
- **Post-processors** (final adjustments before deployment).  

#### Example: Ubuntu packer template  

```hcl
packer {
  required_version = ">= 1.7.0"
  required_plugins {
    qemu = {
      version = "~> 1.0"
      source  = "github.com/hashicorp/qemu"
    }
  }
}

variable "ubuntu_series" {
  type        = string
  default     = "focal"
  description = "Ubuntu version to build."
}

source "qemu" "cloudimg" {
  iso_url        = "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/${var.ubuntu_series}/current/${var.ubuntu_series}-server-cloudimg-amd64.img"
  disk_size      = "4G"
  memory         = 2048
  cpus           = 2
  headless       = true
}

build {
  sources = ["source.qemu.cloudimg"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    scripts = ["./scripts/setup.sh"]
  }

  post-processor "shell-local" {
    inline = [
      "tar -czf ubuntu-custom.tar.gz /path/to/image"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Uploading packer images to MAAS  

Once built, upload a Packer-generated image via:  

```bash
maas admin boot-resources create \
    name='custom/ubuntu-packer' \
    title='Ubuntu Packer' \
    architecture='amd64/generic' \
    filetype='tgz' \
    content@=ubuntu-custom.tar.gz
```

### Inspecting Packer-Generated Images  

To examine a Packer-created ISO:  

```bash
isoinfo -d -i ubuntu.iso
```

For a directory listing:  

```bash
isoinfo -f -i ubuntu.iso | grep <package>
```

For a structured view:  

```bash
isoinfo -l -i ubuntu.iso
```

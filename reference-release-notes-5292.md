### Capabilities added in MAAS 3.5

MAAS 3.5 delivers substantial improvements in core functionality.  We've integrated Temporal for enhanced process and thread management, and started a transition to Go, re-implementing some of the rack controller functions as the "MAAS agent."  We've standardized logging and monitoring to use tools like syslogd, stepping away from the custom code we had been using.  We've also expanded the capabilities of existing features to include comprehensive service monitoring and support for deploying ephemeral (RAM-only) OS images.  And we've made great strides in visibly improving the performance of MAAS.

#### Faster and more efficient image storage and sync

MAAS previously stored the boot resources (boot-loaders, kernels and disk images) in the MAAS database, and then replicated them on all Rack controllers. This make operations difficult and slow, as the database quickly became huge and files had to be transferred to all Racks before they were available for use. To address this issue, we have moved the resource storage from the database to the Region controller, and repurposed the storage in the Rack.

#### Storing boot resources in the Region Controllers

All boot resources are stored in the local disk in each Controller host (`/var/lib/maas/image-storage` for *deb* or `$SNAP_COMMON/maas/image-storage` for *snap*). MAAS checks the contents of these directories on every start-up, removing unknown/stale files and downloading any missing resource. 

MAAS checks the amount of disk space available before downloading any resource, and stops synchronizing files if there isn't enough free space. This error will be reported in the logs and a banner in the Web UI.

#### Storage use by the Rack Controller 

Images are no longer copied from the MAAS database to the rack. Instead, the rack downloads images from the region on-demand.  This works well with the redesign of the rack controller (now known as the *MAAS agent*), which has been re-imagined as a 4G LRU caching agent.  The MAAS agent has limited storage space, managing cache carefully, but it is possible to configure the size of this cache if you need to do so.

As boot resources are now downloaded from a Region controller on-demand, a fast and reliable network connection between Regions and Racks is essential for a smooth operation. Adjusting the cache size might also be important for performance if you regularly deploy a large number of different systems.

#### One-time image migration process

The first Region controller that upgrades will try to move all images out of the database. This is a background operation performed after all database migrations are applied, and **it's not reversible**. This is also a blocking operation, so MAAS might be un-available for some time (i.e., you should plan for some downtime during the upgrade process). 

MAAS will check if the host has enough disk space before starting to export the resources, and it will not proceed otherwise. In order to discover how much disk space you need for all your images, you can run the following SQL query in MAAS database before upgrading:

```sql
select sum(n."size") from (select distinct on (f."sha256") f."size" from maasserver_bootresourcefile f order by f."sha256") n;
```

The controllers are no longer capable of serving boot resources directly from the database, and won't be able to commission or to deploy machines until this migration succeeds. If the process fails, you must free enough disk space and restart the controller for the migration to be attempted again.

#### Sync works differently

When downloading boot resources from an upstream source (e.g. images.maas.io), MAAS divides the workload between all Region controllers available, so each file is downloaded only once, but not all by the same controller. After all external files were fetched, the controllers synchronize files among them in a peer-to-peer fashion. This requires **direct communication between Regions to be allowed**, so you should review your firewall rules before upgrading.

In this new model, a given image is *only* available for deployment after *all* regions have it, although stale versions can be used until everyone is up to date. This differs from previous versions where the boot resource needed to be copied to all Rack controllers before it was available, meaning that the images should be ready for use sooner.

#### Faster machine listing when deploying many machines

We have made the MAAS machine listing considerably faster for large page sizes.

#### Soft Power Off

MAAS 3.5 allows you to execute a "soft" power-off for one or more machines.  Rather than commanding a power-off via the BMC, MAAS will ask the running OS to power-down the machine.  This allows machines to go through their normal shutdown routines before powering off.

#### Improved "Select All" in the machine list

With MAAS 3.5, you can select only the machines that are visible on the current page. 

#### Improved support for multipath storage devices

MAAS support of multipath storage devices has been reviewed and improved, and now it's capable of correctly identifying the following technologies:

* SCSI
* iSCSI
* Fiber Channel
* SAS (including wide port and expanders)

When one of these devices is detected by the commissioning scripts, MAAS will suppress the duplicated disks.

#### MAAS services exposed as Prometheus metrics

All services found in the *Hardware > Controllers > <controller> > Services* panel are now exposed as Prometheus metrics, to include: 

- regiond
- bind9
- NTP
- proxy
- syslog
- reverse-proxy
- rackd
- HTTP
- TFTP
- dhcpd(v4)
- dhcpd6
- DNS

This should improve the user's ability to monitor MAAS.

#### Monitoring setup sequence updated

Also, the monitoring setup sequence for MAAS [has changed](/t/how-to-monitor-maas/5204).

#### Logs collapsed into system log files

With the advent of 3.5, all of the separate logs used by MAAS through version 3.4 have been eliminated and replaced with logging into the standard `systemd` files.  See [How to use MAAS systemd logs](/t/how-to-use-maas-systemd-logs/8103) in the documentation set for details.

#### Deployment of Oracle Linux 8 and 9 on MAAS machines

Concurrent with the release of MAAS 3.5, we have added Oracle Linux 8 and Oracle Linux 9 to the stable of custom OS images that can be deployed on MAAS machines.

#### Ephemeral OS deployments

With the release of MAAS 3.5, ephemeral deployments for Ubuntu and custom images should succeed.  Networking is only set up for Ubuntu images. For non-Ubuntu images, you only get the PXE interface set up to do DHCP against MAAS. All other interfaces need to be configured manually after deployment.

You can choose an ephemeral OS deployment from the deployment configuration screen in the machine list: Just select the "Deploy in memory" option and deploy as normal.

#### New filters to support ephemeral deployments

You can now select two new filters for deployment targets: "Deployed in memory" and "Deployed to disk."

#### Machine release scripts

MAAS now supports machine release scripts -- scripts that will be run when releasing a machine from deployment.  These scripts run on an ephemeral copy of Ubuntu that is loaded after the deployed OS has been shut down.  This ephemeral Ubuntu is similar to the OS image used to commission machines.

Release scripts are the same type of scripts that you can create for commissioning or testing, with one difference: `script_type: release`.  Here's a sample release script:

```nohighlight
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#
# hello-maas - Simple release script.

# --- Start MAAS 1.0 script metadata ---
# name: hello-maas

import socket

host = '10.10.10.10'
port = 3333
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((host, port))
s.sendall(b'Hello, MAAS')
s.close()
```

You can upload release scripts via API or CLI with a command similar to this one:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE node-scripts create type=release name='hello-maas' script@=/home/ubuntu/hello-maas.py
```

You can check your uploaded release scripts like this:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE node-scripts read type=release
```

Among listed scripts you might see one named `wipe-disks`. This is the script that comes with MAAS to support the *Disk Erase* functionality.

Once you have your script uploaded to MAAS, you can pass it as a parameter to the MAAS CLI:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE machine release $SYSTEM_ID scripts=hello-maas
```

You can inspect release script results via the MAAS CLI:

```nohighlight
maas $PROFILE node-script-results read $SYSTEM_ID type=release
```

#### "Agent" and "Temporal" controller services

MAAS 3.5 makes some internal changes to improve the operation of MAAS, including:

- adding a rack agent to assist the rack controller (this agent will eventually replace the rack controller).

- using a product called Temporal to improve process management and scheduling.

There are no exposed controls, and there is no need for users to take any action on these changes. You will, though, see two new services in *Controllers > <controller> > Services: "agent" and "temporal."

### MAAS 3.4 has been released

We are happy to announce that MAAS 3.4 has been released.

### New capabilities in MAAS 3.4

MAAS 3.4 provides several new features.

#### Redesigned UI

The MAAS User Interface (UI) has undergone a significant redesign, introducing the MAAS UI new layout. This new layout incorporates various features and improvements aimed at enhancing the user experience for MAAS users and operators who primarily interact with the UI.  The MAAS UI new layout introduces several enhancements that aim to improve usability, customization, and navigation within the application

- Customized column visibility: One of the major improvements in the MAAS UI new layout is the ability for users to customize the visibility of columns on the machine list. This feature empowers users to focus on the specific information they need, while hiding irrelevant columns. By allowing users to tailor their view, this enhancement improves readability, reduces clutter, and provides a more personalized experience.

- Action forms in side panel: Previously, the action forms in MAAS were located in the header section, which made it less intuitive for users to access and interact with them. The redesigned UI moves these action forms to the side panel, providing a more logical placement and easy access to perform actions on machines. This change enhances the usability of the forms and improves the overall workflow for users.

- Streamlined action button group: The introduction of a new action button group eliminates the need for the previous "Take action" menu. Users can now directly access commonly used actions for machines, both in the details view and the machine list. This streamlines the workflow and simplifies the process of performing actions on machines, saving users time and effort.

- Improved side navigation: To enhance navigation within the application, the MAAS UI new layout implements a new side navigation system. Users can conveniently navigate through different sections of the app using the side panel. Additionally, the inclusion of a secondary side navigation specifically for settings and account pages improves the organization and accessibility of these sections.

##### Intended Benefits

The MAAS UI was redesigned with several user benefits in mind.

- Enhanced table interaction: Users can now customize their views by selecting the columns they care about the most. This modular table feature allows for a personalized experience, ensuring users can focus on the information that matters to them.

- Improved form interaction: Forms in the MAAS UI have been redesigned to scale with the content. By migrating all forms into panels, users have more space to view other components such as the machine list, resulting in a more comfortable and efficient form interaction experience.

- Efficient navigation: The new layout addresses the challenges posed by a growing navigation menu. With the introduction of the side panel navigation, users can easily explore different sections of the app, providing a scalable and user-friendly navigation experience.

- Enhanced search capability: The MAAS UI new layout improves the efficiency of the search feature. Users can search for machines based on conventions and tags, making it easier to find specific machines and take actions. The new layout also provides clearer feedback when the "take action" button is disabled, enhancing the overall search and interaction experience.

- Performance improvements based on user feedback: Based on user feedback received through Discourse, several performance issues have been identified and addressed. The MAAS team has worked diligently to optimize machine information loading times and resolve delays encountered while opening machine pages. These performance improvements ensure a smoother and faster user experience when interacting with the MAAS UI.

The MAAS UI new layout introduces a redesigned interface with enhanced features to provide a more efficient and user-friendly experience for MAAS users and operators. By allowing users to customize their views, streamlining form interactions

<!--
- DGX kernel support: There’s ongoing work from Canonical to provide an optimized kernel for Nvidia DGX machines. We want to promote that and make sure that DGX machines use that optimized kernel by default, without the user having to do any special configuration.
-->

#### Configurable session timeout

In MAAS 3.4, we've introduced the Configurable Session Timeout feature, offering better control over session length. This feature allows you to set a personalized duration for your sessions, hopefully avoiding abrupt disconnections or lingering sessions.  If you're a user who has login repeatedly, due to short session defaults, or you're concerned about leaving your session accessible for too long, setting a custom timeout is useful and potentially more secure.

#### Packer MAAS - SLES

The MAAS 3.4 release expands Packer support to include SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), expanding the the list of deployable Linux distributions.  We also support openSUSE and openSUSE Tumbleweed. And we’ve added a template for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 9.

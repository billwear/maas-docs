## Available configuration items

- **:active_discovery_interval:** Active subnet mapping interval. When enabled, each rack will scan subnets enabled for active mapping. This helps ensure discovery information is accurate and complete.
- **:auto_vlan_creation:** Automatically create VLANs and Fabrics for interfaces.  Enables the creation of a default VLAN and Fabric for discovered network interfaces when MAAS cannot connect it to an existing one. When disabled, the interface is left disconnected in these cases. 
- **:boot_images_auto_import:** Automatically import/refresh the boot images every 60 minutes.
- **:boot_images_no_proxy:** Set no_proxy with the image repository address when MAAS is behind (or set with) a proxy..  By default, when MAAS is behind (and set with) a proxy, it is used to download images from the image repository. In some situations (e.g. when using a local image repository) it doesn't make sense for MAAS to use the proxy to download images because it can access them directly. Setting this option allows MAAS to access the (local) image repository directly by setting the no_proxy variable for the MAAS env with the address of the image repository. 
- **:commissioning_distro_series:** Default Ubuntu release used for commissioning.
- **:completed_intro:** Marks if the initial intro has been completed.
- **:curtin_verbose:** Run the fast-path installer with higher verbosity. This provides more detail in the installation logs.

- **:disk_erase_with_quick_erase:** Use quick erase by default when erasing disks..  This is not a secure erase; it wipes only the beginning and end of each disk. 
- **:disk_erase_with_secure_erase:** Use secure erase by default when erasing disks.  Will only be used on devices that support secure erase. Other devices will fall back to full wipe or quick erase depending on the selected options. 
- **:dns_trusted_acl:** List of external networks (not previously known), that will be allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution..  MAAS keeps a list of networks that are allowed to use MAAS for DNS resolution. This option allows to add extra networks (not previously known) to the trusted ACL where this list of networks is kept. It also supports specifying IPs or ACL names. 
- **:dnssec_validation:** Enable DNSSEC validation of upstream zones.  Only used when MAAS is running its own DNS server. This value is used as the value of 'dnssec_validation' in the DNS server config.

- **:http_proxy:** Proxy for APT or YUM and HTTP/HTTPS.  This will be passed onto provisioned nodes to use as a proxy for APT or YUM traffic. MAAS also uses the proxy for downloading boot images. If no URL is provided, the built-in MAAS proxy will be used. 
- **:kernel_opts:** Boot parameters to pass to the kernel by default.

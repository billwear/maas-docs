Prior to deployment, MAAS machines can be customized in a number of ways, including:

- machine storage.
- commissioning and deployment configurations (known as "pre-seeding").
- custom Ubuntu kernels.
- kernel boot options. 

In MAAS v3.2+, machines can be modified post-deployment — while running — by swapping hardware or adjusting the VM from the host. This enables you to:

- add or remove disks
- add or remove network interfaces
- add or remove PCI devices
- add or remove USB devices

You cannot make these changes to a deployed machine using MAAS.

During deployment, you can enable periodic hardware sync, allowing deployed machines to update BMC settings and tags in real time as changes occur.

## Customizing storage 

MAAS configures machine storage, supporting traditional partitioning, LVM, RAID, bcache, and UEFI boot.

MAAS does not support deploying ZFS beyond the root device; doing so is not recommended.

Storage depends on physical disks but is configured using a layout, applied during commissioning. Modify storage at the filesystem level post-deployment and choose from various disk erasure options when releasing a machine.

MAAS supports storage setup for CentOS and RHEL, including RAID, LVM, and custom partitioning (excluding ZFS and bcache). This requires an updated Curtin version, [available via PPA](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curtin).

### Flat storage layout

The flat storage layout in MAAS offers a straightforward disk configuration, ideal for environments where simplicity and ease of deployment are paramount.

#### Overview

In the Flat layout, the entire boot disk is utilized to create a single root partition, formatted with the ext4 filesystem and mounted at the root (`/`). For systems utilizing UEFI, a separate EFI System Partition (ESP) is created to facilitate the boot process.

#### Partition Scheme

| Device | Size        | Type           | Filesystem | Mount Point |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| sda    | -           | disk           | -          | -           |
| sda1   | 512 MB      | partition      | FAT32      | /boot/efi   |
| sda2   | Remaining   | partition      | ext4       | /           |

*Note: If the system is not using UEFI, the EFI partition (`sda1`) is omitted, and the root partition (`sda2`) occupies the entire disk.*

#### Configuration options

When setting up the Flat layout in MAAS, the following options can be customized:

- `boot_size`: Defines the size of the boot partition. Default is 0, placing `/boot` on the root filesystem.

- `root_device`: Specifies the block device for the root partition. Default is the boot disk.

- `root_size`: Determines the size of the root partition. Default is 100%, utilizing the entire root device.

#### Use cases

The Flat layout is particularly well-suited for:

- Standard deployments where advanced storage configurations are unnecessary.

- Testing and development scenarios requiring rapid provisioning and minimal setup.

- Systems with limited storage devices or where simplicity is preferred.

#### Considerations

While the Flat layout offers simplicity, it may not be suitable for all scenarios:

- Does not support advanced features like logical volume management or disk caching.

- Cannot span multiple physical disks or implement RAID configurations.

- May not meet the needs of complex or large-scale deployments requiring sophisticated storage setups.

For deployments necessitating advanced storage configurations, consider using the LVM, bcache, or custom layouts provided by MAAS.

### LVM layout

The LVM (Logical Volume Management) layout in MAAS provides a flexible disk configuration, allowing for dynamic resizing and management of storage volumes.

LVM abstracts physical storage devices, grouping physical drives into volume groups. LVM supports logical volumes that span multiple disks, which makes it easy to resize volumes and move data with minimal downtime.

In the context of MAAS, the LVM layout offers very efficient storage management, with features like backup snapshots and dynamic resizing of volumes.  LVM is indicated storage requirements frequently change over the lifetime of a machine.

#### Overview

In the LVM layout, MAAS configures the storage as follows:

- A 512 MB EFI System Partition (ESP) is created for UEFI systems.

- The remaining space on the boot disk is allocated as a physical volume for LVM.

- A volume group named `vgroot` is created on the physical volume.

- Within `vgroot`, a logical volume named `lvroot` is created, formatted with the ext4 filesystem, and mounted at the root (`/`).

#### Partition scheme

| Device | Size        | Type           | Filesystem | Mount Point |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| sda    | -           | disk           | -          | -           |
| sda1   | 512 MB      | partition      | FAT32      | /boot/efi   |
| sda2   | Remaining   | partition      | lvm-pv(vgroot) | -        |
| lvroot | Remaining   | logical volume | ext4       | /           |

#### Configuration options

When setting up the LVM layout in MAAS, the following options can be customized:

- `vg_name`: Specifies the name of the volume group. Default is `vgroot`.

- `lv_name`: Specifies the name of the logical volume. Default is `lvroot`.

- `lv_size`: Defines the size of the logical volume. Default is the entire volume group.

#### Use cases

The LVM layout is particularly well-suited for:

- Environments requiring flexible disk management, such as resizing or adding volumes.

- Systems that benefit from snapshot capabilities for backups or testing.

- Deployments where storage requirements may change over time.

#### Considerations

While the LVM layout offers flexibility, it may introduce additional complexity:

- Requires understanding of LVM concepts for effective management.

- May not be necessary for simple or static storage needs.

For scenarios requiring advanced storage configurations, such as combining multiple disks or implementing caching mechanisms, consider using custom layouts or other storage options provided by MAAS.

### bcache layout

The bcache layout in MAAS enhances disk performance by combining a slower backing device with a faster cache device.

#### Overview

In the bcache layout, the boot disk serves as the backing device, while the smallest SSD-tagged block device is used as the cache. The bcache device is formatted with the ext4 filesystem and mounted at the root (`/`). If no SSD-tagged devices are available, MAAS defaults to the Flat layout.

#### Partition scheme

| Device | Size        | Type           | Filesystem | Mount Point |
|--------|-------------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| sda    | -           | disk           | -          | -           |
| sda1   | 512 MB      | partition      | FAT32      | /boot/efi   |
| sda2   | Remaining   | partition      | bc-backing | -           |
| sdb    | -           | disk (SSD)     | -          | -           |
| sdb1   | 100% of sdb | partition      | bc-cache   | -           |
| bcache0| per sda2    | disk           | ext4       | /           |

#### Configuration options

When setting up the bcache layout in MAAS, the following options can be customized:

- `boot_size`: Size of the boot partition on the boot disk. Default is 0, placing `/boot` on the root filesystem.

- `root_device`: The block device upon which to place the root partition. Default is the boot disk.

- `root_size`: Size of the root partition. Default is 100%, utilizing the entire root device.

- `cache_device`: The block device to use as the cache device. Default is the smallest block device tagged as SSD.

- `cache_mode`: The cache mode to set for the bcache device. Default is `writethrough`.

- `cache_size`: The size of the partition on the cache device. Default is 100%, meaning the entire size of the cache device.

- `cache_no_part`: Whether to create a partition on the cache device. Default is false, meaning a partition will be created using the given `cache_size`. If set to true, no partition will be created, and the raw cache device will be used.

#### Use cases

The bcache layout is particularly beneficial in scenarios where:

- Improving I/O performance without replacing existing HDDs.

- Leveraging affordable SSDs to cache data for larger, slower disks.

- Applications involve frequent read operations, benefiting from cached data.

#### Considerations

- The bcache layout requires at least one SSD-tagged device to function.

- If no suitable cache device is found, MAAS defaults to the Flat layout.

- Proper configuration of cache parameters is essential to achieve desired performance benefits. 

### RAID and MAAS

RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) in MAAS offers a method to enhance storage performance by combining multiple physical disks into a single logical unit. MAAS supports both software and hardware RAID configurations, each with its own setup considerations.

#### Software RAID

MAAS allows the configuration of software RAID arrays during the deployment process. Users can define RAID levels (such as RAID 0, 1, 5) through the MAAS CLI or API, specifying parameters like member disks and spare devices. For instance, a user can create a RAID 1 array for mirroring data across two disks, enhancing fault tolerance.

#### Hardware RAID

For systems equipped with hardware RAID controllers, MAAS can integrate their configurations using custom commissioning scripts. These scripts can utilize vendor-specific tools (e.g., `storcli` for Broadcom LSI controllers or `hpssacli` for HP Smart Array controllers) to set up RAID arrays during the commissioning phase. It is important to ensure that these tools are compatible with the commissioning environment, which typically runs Ubuntu.

In scenarios where proprietary RAID management tools are only available for other operating systems (e.g., RHEL), users may need to explore alternative methods or consult vendor documentation for compatibility solutions.

### UEFI booting 

All layout types support UEFI boot, with MAAS automatically creating a 512MB FAT32 EFI partition (/boot/efi on sda1). Users need only enable UEFI — no further action is required. However, UEFI must remain enabled throughout the machine’s life-cycle; disabling it after enlistment will cause failures.

### Block devices 

Once the initial storage layout has been configured on a machine, you can perform many operations to view and adjust the entire storage layout for the machine. In MAAS there are two different types of block devices.

**Physical* 

A physical block device is a physically attached block device such as a 100GB hard drive connected to a server.

**Virtual* 

A virtual block device is a block device that is exposed by the Linux kernel when an operation is performed. Almost all the operations on a physical block device can be performed on a virtual block device, such as a RAID device exposed as md0.

### Partitions 

As with block devices, MAAS and the MAAS API offer a great deal of control over the creation, formatting, mounting and deletion of partitions.

## Storage restrictions 

There are three restrictions for the storage configuration:

1.  An EFI partition is required to be on the boot disk for UEFI.
2.  You cannot place partitions on logical volumes.
3.  You cannot use a logical volume as a Bcache backing device.

Violating these restrictions will prevent a successful deployment.

### VMFS data stores 

MAAS configures VMware VMFS Datastore layouts to maximize local disk use for ESXi. The VMFS6 layout, required for ESXi, creates a datastore1 VMFS Datastore using leftover boot disk space after OS partitioning.

### Final storage mods 

Once MAAS provisions a machine with block devices, via a layout or administrator customization, a regular user can modify the resulting storage configuration at the filesystem level.

### Disk erasure 

Disk erasure removes data from a machine’s disks upon release. Users can set a default configuration or select from three erasure types:

1.  Standard erasure - Overwrites all data with zeros.
2.  Secure erasure -Secure erase works like Standard erase but is much faster since the disk's firmware handles it. However, some disks—especially SCSI, SAS, and FC—may not support this method.
3.  Quick erasure - Same as Standard erase but only targets the first 1 MB and the last 1 MB of each disk. This removes the partition tables and/or superblock from the disk, making data recovery difficult but not impossible.

Pay attention: if all three options are checked when the machine is released, the following order of preference is applied:

1. Use 'secure erase' if the disk supports it
2. If it does not, then use 'quick erase'

## Pre-seeding 

During enlistment, deployment, commissioning, and installation, MAAS sends [Tempita-derived](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravenac95/tempita/master/docs/index.txt) configuration files to cloud-init. This pre-seeding process configures a machine’s ephemeral and installation environments, allowing customization.

Preseeding in MAAS can be achieved in two ways:

1. [Curtin](https://launchpad.net/curtin), a preseeding system similar to Kickstart or d-i (Debian Installer), applies customization during operating system (OS) image installation. MAAS performs these changes on deployment, during OS installation, but before the machine reboots into the installed OS. Curtin customizations are perfect for administrators who want their deployments to have identical setups all the time, every time. [This blog post](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2017/06/02/customising-maas-installs) contains an excellent high-level overview of custom MAAS installs using Curtin.

2. [Cloud-init](https://launchpad.net/cloud-init), a system for setting up machines immediately after instantiation. cloud-init applies customizations after the first boot, when MAAS changes a machine's status to 'Deployed.' Customizations are per-instance, meaning that user-supplied scripts must be re-specified on redeployment. Cloud-init customizations are the best way for MAAS users to customise their deployments, similar to how the various cloud services prepare VMs when launching instances.

## Tempita templates

Tempita templates are used to generate preseed files during machine enlistment, commissioning, and deployment phases. These templates, located in /etc/maas/preseeds/, create configuration files that guide machine setup. For instance, during commissioning, MAAS uses these templates to send configuration data to the cloud-init process on target machines.

### Templates (snap) 

The [Tempita](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravenac95/tempita/master/docs/index.txt) template files are found in the `/var/snap/maas/current/preseeds/` directory on the region controller. Each template uses a filename prefix that corresponds to a particular phase of MAAS machine deployment:

### Templates (deb) 

The [Tempita](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravenac95/tempita/master/docs/index.txt) template files are found in the `/etc/maas/preseeds/` directory on the region controller. Each template uses a filename prefix that corresponds to a particular phase of MAAS machine deployment:

|       Phase       |                 Filename prefix                 |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| Enlistment  |                      enlist                     |
| Commissioning |                  commissioning                  |
| Installation | curtin ([Curtin](https://launchpad.net/curtin)) |

Additionally, the template for each phase typically consists of two files. The first is a higher-level file that often contains little more than a URL or a link to further credentials, while a second file contains the executable logic.

The `enlist` template, for example, contains only minimal variables, whereas `enlist_userdata` includes both user variables and initialization logic.

Tempura's inheritance mechanism is the reverse of what you might expect. Inherited files, such as `enlist_userdata`, become the new template which can then reference variables from the higher-level file, such as `enlist`.

### Template naming 

MAAS interprets templates in lexical order by their filename. This order allows for base configuration options and parameters to be overridden based on a combination of operating system, architecture, sub-architecture, release, and machine name.

Some earlier versions of MAAS only support Ubuntu. If the machine operating system is Ubuntu, then filenames without `{OS}` will also be tried, to maintain backward compatibility.

Consequently, template files are interpreted in the following order:

1. `{prefix}_{OS}_{node_arch}_{node_sub arch}_{release}_{node_name}` or `{prefix}_{node_arch}_{node_sub arch}_{release}_{node_name}`

2. `{prefix}_{OS}_{node_arch}_{node_sub arch}_{release}` or `{prefix}_{node_arch}_{node_sub arch}_{release}`

3. `{prefix}_{OS}_{node_arch}_{node_sub arch}` or `{prefix}_{node_arch}_{node_sub arch}`

4. `{prefix}_{OS}_{node_arch}` or `{prefix}_{node_arch}`

5. `{prefix}_{OS}`

6. `{prefix}`

7. `generic`

The machine needs to be the machine name, as shown in the web UI URL.

The prefix can be either `enlist`, `enlist_userdata`, `commissioning`, `curtin`, `curtin_userdata` or `preseed_master`. Alternatively, you can omit the prefix and the following underscore.

For example, to create a generic configuration template for Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial running on an x64 architecture, the file would need to be called `ubuntu_amd64_generic_xenial_node`.

To create the equivalent template for curtin_userdata, the file would be called `curtin_userdata_ubuntu_amd64_generic_xenial_node`.

Any file targeting a specific machine will replace the values and configuration held within any generic files. If those values are needed, you will need to copy these generic template values into your new file.


## Custom Ubuntu kernels

MAAS supports four types of kernels for its Ubuntu machines:

- General availability kernels
- Hardware enablement kernels
- Hardware enablement kernels (pre-release)
- Low latency kernels

### GA kernels 

The *general availability* (GA) kernel is based on the *generic* kernel that ships with a new Ubuntu version. Subsequent fixes are applied regularly by the 'stable' *stream* used when setting up the global image source for MAAS.

MAAS denotes a GA kernel like this:

`ga-<version>`: The GA kernel reflects the major kernel version of the shipped Ubuntu release. For example, 'ga-16.04' is based on the 'generic' 4.4 Ubuntu kernel. As per Ubuntu policy, a GA kernel will never have its major version upgraded until the underlying release is upgraded.

### HWE kernels 

New hardware gets released all the time. If an Ubuntu host runs an older kernel, it is unlikely that MAAS can support the hardware. Canonical does make every effort to back-port more recent kernels enabling more hardware. The acronym HWE stands for "Hardware Enablement."

You also gain kernel improvements and new features when installing an HWE kernel.


There is the notion of an HWE *stack*, which refers to the window manager and kernel when the Ubuntu host is running a desktop environment. HWE stacks do not apply to MAAS since machines are provisioned strictly as non-graphical servers.


Note that these back-ported/HWE kernels are only available for LTS releases (e.g. Trusty, Xenial, etc.). For example, the first available HWE kernel for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) will be the GA kernel from Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety).

Before MAAS 2.1 on Xenial, HWE kernels are referred to by the notation `hwe-<release letter>`. So, to install the Yakkety HWE kernel on Xenial, the `hwe-y` kernel is used. By default, when using the web UI, MAAS imports all available HWE kernels along with its generic boot images. So if you are importing Trusty images, then the following HWE kernels are included: `hwe-u`, `hwe-v`, `hwe-w`, `hwe-x` (presuming the Xenial HWE kernel is available).

In MAAS 2.1, starting with Xenial kernels, the notation has changed. The following is used to refer to the latest HWE kernel available for Xenial: `hwe-16.04`.

See [LTS Enablement Stack](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack) (Ubuntu wiki) for the latest information on HWE.

### Pre-release HWE 

The pre-release HWE kernel is known as the *edge* HWE kernel.

MAAS denotes the edge kernel like this: `hwe-<version>-edge`.

So 'hwe-16.04' is considered older than 'hwe-16.04-edge'.

See [Rolling LTS Enablement Stack](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/RollingLTSEnablementStack#hwe-16.04-edge) (Ubuntu wiki) for more information.

### Low-latency kernels 

The low-latency kernel is based on the GA kernel, but uses a more aggressive configuration to reduce latency. It is categorized as a soft real-time kernel. 

MAAS denotes a low latency kernel in three ways:

1.  `hwe-x-lowlatency`: the Xenial low latency HWE kernel for Trusty
2.  `ga-16.04-lowlatency`: the low latency GA kernel for Xenial
3.  `hwe-16.04-lowlatency`: the low latency HWE kernel for Xenial

### Choosing a kernel 

The kernel installed on a machine during deployment is, by default, the Ubuntu release's native kernel (GA). However, it is possible to tell MAAS to use a different kernel. Via the Web UI, MAAS can help you choose one of these kernels. There are three different contexts for your choice:

1.  globally (default minimum enlistment and commissioning kernel)
2.  per machine (minimum deploy kernel)
3.  per machine during deployment (specific deploy kernel)

## Kernel boot options 

MAAS can specify kernel boot options to machines on both a global basis (UI and CLI) and a per-machine basis (CLI-only). A full catalog of available options can be found in the [Linux kernel parameters list](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html) at [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org).

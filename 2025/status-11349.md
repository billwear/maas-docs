Running `maas status` in the MAAS CLI provides an overview of key services. Understanding these services is essential for management and troubleshooting:  

- **Regiond (Region Controller):** Manages the MAAS environment, handling API requests, PostgreSQL, DNS, caching, and the web UI.  
- **Rackd (Rack Controller):** Manages physical machines, providing DHCP, TFTP, and power control under the region controller.  
- **Bind9 (DNS):** Provides domain name resolution for managed machines.  
- **DHCPD (DHCP):** Assigns IP addresses during commissioning and deployment.  
- **TFTP:** Transfers boot images for PXE booting.  
- **NTP:** Synchronizes system clocks for accurate logging and coordination.  
- **HTTP (Nginx):** Acts as a reverse proxy and serves the MAAS web interface.  
- **Proxy (Squid):** Caches frequently accessed data to optimize network efficiency.  

Monitoring these services with `maas status` ensures smooth infrastructure operation.

MAAS logs help you find issues, spot configuration mistakes, and audit the use of your system.  Several types of logs are supported, including:

- System logs
- Event logs
- Commissioning logs
- Testing logs
- Audit event logs

Each of these has a specific purpose, as described in this document.

## Checking Logs in Systemd (MAAS 3.5 and Newer)

Starting with version 3.5, MAAS logs are saved in systemd. Use these commands to view the logs based on how you installed MAAS (snap or Debian packages):

### Region Controller Logs

 - Snap: `journalctl -u snap.maas.pebble -t maas-regiond`

 - Debian: `journalctl -u maas-regiond`

### Rack Controller Logs

 - `Snap: journalctl -u snap.maas.pebble -t maas-rackd`

 - `Debian: journalctl -u maas-rackd`

### Agent Logs

 - Snap: `journalctl -u snap.maas.pebble -t maas-agent`

 - Debian: `journalctl -u maas-agent`

### API Server Logs

 - Snap: `journalctl -u snap.maas.pebble -t maas-apiserver`

 - Debian: `journalctl -u maas-apiserver`

### Filtering Logs by Machine Name

To search for logs by machine name (hostname):

```
journalctl -u snap.maas.pebble -t maas-machine --since "-15m" MAAS_MACHINE_HOSTNAME=ace-cougar
```

## Checking Logs Before MAAS 3.5

Before version 3.5, MAAS saved logs in custom files. Here are some examples:

 - Region Controller: `/var/snap/maas/common/log/regiond.log` or `/var/log/maas/regiond.log`

 - Rack Controller: `/var/snap/maas/common/log/rackd.log` or `/var/log/maas/rackd.log`

 - Proxy: `/var/snap/maas/common/log/proxy/access.log`

### Using the less Command to Read Logs

```
less /var/snap/maas/common/log/regiond.log
```

## How to Read Event Logs

### Using the UI

 1. Go to the Machines list in the UI.

 2. Click on a machine and select the Events tab.

To see more details, click *View full history*.

### Using the Command Line

```
maas $PROFILE events query
```

### Formatting Event Logs with jq

To format the output neatly with jq:

```
maas admin events query | jq -r '(["HOSTNAME","TIMESTAMP","TYPE","DESCRIPTION"] | (., map(length*"-"))), (.events[] | [.hostname, .created, .type, .description // "-"]) | @tsv' | column -t -s $'\t'
```

## How to Read Commissioning Logs

### Using the UI

 1. Go to the Commissioning tab of a machine.

 2. Click the links to see the detailed logs.

### Using the Command Line

```
maas $PROFILE node-script-result read $SYSTEM_ID $RESULTS
```

## How to Read Testing Logs

Example Command:

```
maas $PROFILE node-script-result read $SYSTEM_ID type=smartctl-validate
```

## Auditing MAAS

Track user actions at a granular level.

### List audit events

To get a list of MAAS audit events, you can use the following MAAS CLI command:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT
```

This command will list all audit events. The output will include details such as username, hostname, date, and event description.

### Filter events by hostname

To filter audit events by a specific hostname, use the following MAAS CLI command:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT hostname=your-hostname
```

Replace `your-hostname` with the desired hostname. This command will list audit events specific to the provided hostname.

### Filter events by MAC

If you want to filter audit events by a specific MAC address, use this MAAS CLI command:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT mac_address=00:11:22:33:44:55
```

Replace `00:11:22:33:44:55` with the MAC address you want to filter by. This command will display audit events related to the specified MAC address.

### Filter events by SYSID

To filter audit events by a specific system ID, use the following MAAS CLI command:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT id=system-id
```

Replace `system-id` with the desired system ID. This command will list audit events specific to the provided system ID.

### Filter events by zone

If you want to filter audit events by a specific zone, use the following MAAS CLI command:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT zone=your-zone
```

Replace `your-zone` with the desired zone name. This command will display audit events for machines in the specified zone.

### Filter events by owner

To filter audit events by the owner of the machine, use this MAAS CLI command:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT owner=owner-username
```

Replace `owner-username` with the username of the machine's owner. This command will list audit events for machines owned by the specified user.

### Limit event count

You can limit the number of audit events displayed using the `limit` parameter. For example:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT limit=10
```

This command will limit the output to the last 10 audit events. You can adjust the limit to your preference.

### Move event window

To display audit events occurring after a specific event ID, you can use the `after` parameter. For example:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT after=event-id
```

Replace `event-id` with the ID of the event you want to start from. This command will display audit events that occurred after the specified event.

### Audit life-cycles

To audit a machine's life cycle, you can collect audit data for a specific machine over time. First, collect a significant amount of audit data for the machine using the hostname filter:

```nohighlight
$ maas $PROFILE events query level=AUDIT hostname=your-hostname limit=1000 > /tmp/audit-data
```

This command will retrieve a substantial number of audit events for the specified hostname and store them in a file named `audit-data`.

Next, you can analyze this data to track changes, actions, and events related to the machine's life cycle. This can help in troubleshooting and monitoring machine behavior over time.

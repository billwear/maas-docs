If you have created a VM host, you will want to create and delete virtual machines (VMs).  You can use either the CLI or the UI for these operations; this article explains how.

<h2 id="heading--add-vm-from-ui">Adding a VM from the Web UI</h2>

While on VM host's details view, select 'Compose' from the 'Take action' drop-down menu to compose a machine.

![compose-machine|690x276](upload://l2xt3r8dfg1wJ62NTvwJg1qprzK.jpeg) 

You can choose which storage pool to use from a drop-down list. 

Click the 'Compose machine' button when you're finished. MAAS will present the VM host detail view. In a few moments, your new machine will be auto-commissioned. The 'Machines' page will reflect this as well.

MAAS will deduct the new machine's resources from the VM host's resources:

<h2 id="heading--adding-a-vm-from-the-cli">Adding a VM from the CLI</h2>

To compose a basic VM:

    maas $PROFILE vm-host compose $VM_HOST_ID

Example output for default composing:

    {
        "system_id": "73yxmc",
        "resource_uri": "/MAAS/api/2.0/machines/73yxmc/"
    }

<h3 id="heading--set-resources">Set resources while adding a VM</h3>

Compose with resources specified:

    maas $PROFILE vm-host compose $VM_HOST_ID $RESOURCES

Where $RESOURCES is a space-separated list of constraints:

* *cores=* requested cores
* *cpu_speed=* requested minimum cpu speed in MHz
* *memory=* requested memory in MB
* *architecture=* See [Architecture](#heading--architecture) below 
* *storage=* See [Storage](#heading--storage) below
* *interfaces=* See [Interfaces](#heading--interfaces) below

<h3 id="heading--architecture">Setting the architecture while adding a VM</h3>

To list available architectures:

    maas $PROFILE boot-resources read

Then, for example:

    maas $PROFILE vm-host compose $VM_HOST_ID \
        cores=40 cpu_speed=2000 memory=7812 architecture="amd64/generic"

<h3 id="heading--storage">Setting storage parameters while adding a VM</h3>

Storage parameters look like this:

    storage="<label>:<size in GB>(<storage pool name>),<label>:<size in GB>(<storage pool name>)"

For example, to compose a machine with the following disks:

-   32 GB disk from storage pool `pool1`
-   64 GB disk from storage pool `pool2`

where we want the first disk to be a bootable root partition `/` and the second to be a home directory.

First, create the VM:

    maas $PROFILE vm-host compose $VM_HOST_ID "storage=mylabel:32(pool1),mylabel:64(pool2)"

Note that the labels, here `mylabel`, are an ephemeral convenience that you might find useful in scripting MAAS actions.

MAAS will create a VM with 2 disks, `/dev/vda` (32 GB) and `/dev/vdb` (64 GB). After MAAS enlists, commissions and acquires the machine, you can edit the disks before deploying to suit your needs. For example, we'll set a boot, root, and home partition.

We'll start by deleting the `/` partition MAAS created because we want a separate `/boot` partition to demonstrate how yo.

    maas admin partition delete $VM_HOST_ID $DISK1_ID $PARTITION_ID

[note]
To find `$DISK1_ID` and `$PARTITION_ID`, use `maas admin machine read $VM_HOST_ID`.
[/note]

Now, create a boot partition (~512MB):

    maas admin partitions create $VM_HOST_ID $DISK1_ID size=512000000 bootable=True

We'll use the remaining space for the root partition, so create another without specifying size:

    maas admin partitions create $VM_HOST_ID $DISK1_ID

Finally, create a partition to use as the home directory. Here we'll use the entire space:

    maas admin partitions create $VM_HOST_ID $DISK2_ID

[note]
To find `$DISK2_ID`, use `maas admin machine read $VM_HOST_ID`.
[/note]

Now, format the partitions. This requires three commands:

    maas admin partition format $VM_HOST_ID $DISK1_ID $BOOT_PARTITION_ID fstype=ext2
    maas admin partition format $VM_HOST_ID $DISK1_ID $ROOT_PARTITION_ID fstype=ext4
    maas admin partition format $VM_HOST_ID $DISK2_ID $HOME_PARTITION_ID fstype=ext4

[note]
To find the partition IDs, use `maas admin partitions read $VM_HOST_ID $DISK1_ID` and `maas admin partitions read $VM_HOST_ID $DISK2_ID`
[/note]

Before you can deploy the machine with our partition layout, you need to mount the new partitions. Here, we'll do that in three commands:

    maas admin partition mount $SYSTEM_ID $DISK1_ID $BOOT_PARTITION_ID     "mount_point=/boot"
    maas admin partition mount $SYSTEM_ID $DISK1_ID $ROOT_PARTITION_ID "mount_point=/"
    maas admin partition mount $SYSTEM_ID $DISK2_ID $HOME_PARTITION_ID "mount_point=/home"

Finally, we deploy the machine. MAAS will use the partitions as we have defined them, similar to a normal Ubuntu desktop install:

    maas admin machine deploy $SYSTEM_ID

<h3 id="heading--interfaces">Specifying interfaces while adding a VM</h3>

Using the `interfaces` constraint, you can compose virtual machines with interfaces, allowing the selection of VM host NICs.

If you don't specify an `interfaces` constraint, MAAS maintains backward compatibility by checking for a `maas` network, then a `default` network to which to connect the virtual machine.

If you specify an `interfaces` constraint, MAAS creates a `bridge` or `macvlan` attachment to the networks that match the given constraint. MAAS prefers `bridge` interface attachments when possible since this typically results in successful communication.

Consider the following interfaces constraint:

    interfaces=eth0:space=maas,eth1:space=storage

Assuming you deploy the VM host on a machine or controller with access to the `maas` and `storage` [spaces](/t/concepts-and-terms/785#heading--spaces), MAAS will create an `eth0` interface bound to the `maas` space and an `eth1` interface bound to the `storage` space.

Another example tells MAAS to assign unallocated IP addresses:

    interfaces=eth0:ip=172.16.99.42

MAAS automatically converts the `ip` constraint to a VLAN constraint (matching the VLAN which corresponds to the subnet can be found -- e.g. `172.16.99.0/24`.) and assigns the IP address to the newly-composed machine upon allocation.

See the Machines [MAAS API documentation](https://maas.io/docs/api#machines) for a list of all constraint keys.

<h3 id="heading--find-vm-host-ids">Find VM host IDs</h3>

Here's a simple way to find a VM host's ID by name using `jq`:

    maas $PROFILE vm-hosts read | jq '.[] | select (.name=="MyVMHost") | .name, .id'

Example output:

    "MyVMHost"
    1

<h2 id="heading--delete-a-machine">Deleting a VM from the Web UI</h2>

To delete a VM, delete it as you would any other MAAS machine. Select the desired machine from the list of machines and select 'Delete' from the 'Take Action' menu.

![delete-vm|690x400](upload://7xkX3Ha5sv1riMDHEXkuGW7LXd6.jpeg) 

<h2 id="heading--delete-a-vm">Deleting a VM with the CLI</h2>

    maas $PROFILE machine delete $SYSTEM_ID

After you delete a machine, its resources will be available for other VMs.

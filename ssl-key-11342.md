In the MAAS CLI, the `sslkey` parameter was previously used to manage Secure Socket Layer (SSL) keys, which are an obsolete method for secure communication between clients and the MAAS server.  The `sslkey` parameter allowed administrators to add, update, or remove SSL keys and their associated certificates within the MAAS environment.

MAAS now uses TLS (Transport Layer Security), which replaces and deprecates the old SSL capability.  This newer functionality ensures that data transmitted over the network remains secure and confidential.
